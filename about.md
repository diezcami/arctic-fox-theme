Welcome! I'm Josh - a Boston native, third-year college student studying **Computer Science at Northeastern University**[.](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/joshua/)
I am also pursuing a concentration in **Cyber Operations and Security**. This fall, I am spending a semester studying abroad
at the **University of Edinburgh** in the UK[!](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/s1883623/)
<br><br>
I've completed one six-month co-op working full-time as a **Security Consultant / Pen-Tester.** I performed application, network, and mobile penetration testing for client companies. I also executed multiple social engineering campaigns and conducted "red team" assessments against various companies.
<br><br>
I love discovering new music and seeing my favorite bands play live - attending
**\$20 concerts** at small venues is my favorite thing about living in a city like Boston. Help me discover new music and [add a song to my queue]({{ site.url }}/queue).
<br><br>
I also love playing **tennis**, as well as collecting coffee mugs from places I **travel** to. Most of all, I love finding time to play around with technology.
<br><br>
I try to stay involved while on campus. I help organize clubs like **CoSMO** and **nuACM**, as well as participate in groups like **CCDC** and **Survivor Northeastern**.
<br><br>
I'm currently developing **[Parade](https://parade.events/)**, an event discovery app (iOS/Android) for NU clubs. I also post code on [github](https://github.com/joshspicer/), and have some scripts posted as [gists](https://gist.github.com/joshspicer/).

**You can find my email and PGP key [here]({{ site.url }}/contact).**
