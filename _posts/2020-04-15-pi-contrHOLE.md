"Pi ContrHOLE" is a simple [Xamarin Forms Shell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/app-fundamentals/shell/) app to manage your local [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/) instance.  The app provides quick toggles and display information that would be useful at a glance to a pi-hole "admin".

I've released the app on the iOS [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pi-contrhole/id1507963158). If you have an iPhone or iPad, [**download the app for free!**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pi-contrhole/id1507963158)

You can also choose to build the app yourself from [Github](https://github.com/joshspicer/pihole-mobile-app). Since it's Xamarin Forms, you can compile this app for Android as well!
