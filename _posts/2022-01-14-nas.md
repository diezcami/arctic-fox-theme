For a _long_ time i've wanted to add a NAS to my homelab setup.  I found that offerings from Synology seem great, but are quite pricy for the lack of flexibility the device provides.  I decided to build my own homemade NAS device with the following criteria:

- Find a cool "NAS-y" case with at least 4 hot-swappable HDD bays
- Small Form Factor (this is a NAS, I want it to fit on a shelf nicely!)
- Build it myself so I can install any Linux OS on it
- Motherboard with on-board 1Gbe ethernet, the possibility for ECC ram, and at least 4 SATA ports + M.2 (or 5 SATA ports)
- Powerful enough to host a few docker containers/other services, yet efficient enough to keep running the majority of the time
- Resuse as much hardware as I can (I have an 8th gen Intel CPU sitting around along with RAM, etc)

The goal is to have a centralized storage server running some redundant RAID configuration. This will mostly be long-term storage, but i'd like the flexibility of using it to store RSTP or 


## Hardware

> _All the hardware used can also be found on my [PCPartPicker List](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/KJKDCz)._

What sparked this project was me finding a really awesome looking [4-Bay Mini-ITX enclosure by "Will Jaya"](https://www.newegg.com/p/2KH-002U-00003?Item=9SIABEE4A08172).  This had the exact aesthetic I was looking for.

For hardware, a goal of mine was to re-use my 8th generation Intel CPU. I also had 16 GB of RAM that I salvaged from a [previous build](/homelab).  The full rundown includes:

- **Motherboard**: Supermicro X11SCL-IF Mini ITX LGA1151 Motherboard
- **CPU**: Intel Core i5-8400 2.8 GHz 6-Core Processor
- **CPU Cooler**: Noctua NH-L9i chromax.black, Low-Profile CPU Cooler for Intel LGA115x
- **Memory**: Corsair Vengeance LPX 16 GB (2 x 8 GB) DDR4-3000 CL15 Memory
- **System Drive**: Samsung 970 Evo Plus 1 TB M.2-2280 NVME Solid State Drive
- **Data Drives**: Western Digital WD Red Plus 4 TB 3.5" 5400RPM Internal Hard Drive (4x)
- **Enclosure/PSU**: Will Jaya 4-Bay NAS 3.5" Mini-ITX Enclosure w/ 220W 1U Flex PSU

I also needed a 24-pin male-to-female PSU cable (which I picked up from my local Microcenter), since the placement of the motherboard's 24-pin was _just_ too short for the included (non-modular) PSU cables that came with the case.

The [Supermicro board](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/vzJtt6/supermicro-x11scl-if-mini-itx-lga1151-motherboard-mbd-x11scl-if-o)  ended up being a great Mini-ITX choice, given the 8th-gen CPU I was trying to reuse. It has four SATA ports and space for an M.2, which is perfect for this project.

The 4 Western Digital 4TB 3.5" hard drives to fill the hard drive bays were no-brainers. In the end, I have about 12TB usable for storage - seems like plenty for now!

One final note - make sure you have a VGA cable on-hand if you want to use an external display for setup!

## Software 

I ended up going with TrueNAS Core (previously called "FreeNAS"), and it was dead simple to set up!  I joined my four drives to a ZFS pool at RAIDZ1. For my use case, one parity drive should be fine (although I know a lot of people disagree). I created a single volume to start.

### Samba share 

I created a new user in the UI, and enabled sharing my volume as a samba share.  Opening finder on my macbook, the device was immediately visible.

### Cloud backup

I big reason I chose TrueNAS was their ability to easily replicate volumes offsite.  Doing this is equally easy in the UI.
