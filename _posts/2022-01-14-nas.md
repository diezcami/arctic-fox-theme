For a _long_ time i've wanted to add a NAS to my homelab setup.  I found that offerings from Synology seem great, but are quite pricy for the lack of flexibility the device provides.  I decided to build my own homemade NAS device with the following criteria:

- Find a cool "NAS-y" case with at least 4 hot-swappable HDD bays
- Small Form Factor (this is a NAS, I want it to fit on a shelf nicely!)
- Build it myself so I can install any Linux OS on it
- Motherboard with on-board 1Gbe ethernet, the possibility for ECC ram, and at least 4 SATA ports + M.2 (or 5 SATA ports)
- Powerful enough to host a few docker containers/other services, yet efficient enough to keep running the majority of the time
- Resuse as much hardware as I can (I have an 8th gen Intel CPU sitting around along with RAM, etc)

The goal is to have a centralized storage server running some redundant RAID configuration. This will mostly be long-term storage, but i'd like the flexibility of using it to store RSTP or 


## Hardware

What sparked this project was me finding a really awesome looking [4-Bay Mini-ITX enclosure by "Will Jaya"](https://www.newegg.com/p/2KH-002U-00003?Item=9SIABEE4A08172).  This had the exact aesthetic I was looking for.

From here I had to find a board that would work with the 8th-gen CPU I was trying to reuse.  I landed on [this LGA1151 board my Supermicro](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/vzJtt6/supermicro-x11scl-if-mini-itx-lga1151-motherboard-mbd-x11scl-if-o).  It has four SATA ports and space for an M.2, which is perfect for this project.

I decided to get 4 Western Digital 4TB 3.5" hard drives to fill the hard drive bays.  I'm undecided on what software i'll be using to configure RAID, but I intend on doing something like RAID1, so I expect to have around ~`12TB of usable storage - seems plenty for now.
