I cannot emphasize how the myriad of emotion I feel every year when I revisit my monthly playlists from the past twelve months.  I don't often think of myself as an innately creative person, yet each year I feel a sense of pride looking back at the music i've collected.  I don't journal, or really keep much of a record of my life beyond the odd photo during an event. Yet, embedded in these playlists I immediate transport back to a snapshot of my life - the feelings, the people, the relationships either born or fading away. 

This is the fourth year i've "journaled", making it extra difficult to catalog by using morse code abbreviations as playlist names.
