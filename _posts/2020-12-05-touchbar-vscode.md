[**On my Github**](https://github.com/joshspicer/vscode-touchbar-command-shortcuts) you'll find my first (not work-related) [vscode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=joshspicer.touchbarcommandshortcuts) - a simple tool to map your commonly used extension commands to touchbar buttons.

You can map it anyway you'd like in your vscode settings.
