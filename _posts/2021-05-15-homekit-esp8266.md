## Setup

### Arduino IDE

We'll be using the Arduino IDE to write our firmware to our development module.

First, add the following "Additional Boards Manager URL" in the IDE's `Preferences`. 

```
http://Arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json
```

Then, in `Tools` > `Board: X` > `Board Manager`, search and install the ESP8266 board manager.

I bought [these development boards](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B081CSJV2V/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) from Amazon.  In the product description they provided additional instructions on setup. Your specific board may have different settings, mine instructed me to --

- Set ESP8266 board type to `NodeMCU 1.0 (ESP-12E Module)
- Set Flash Size to `4M`
- Set CPU Freqency to `80 Mhz`
- Set bod speed to  `921600`

I then simply attached my device via microUSB, selected my device via the "port", and ran the Arduino pre-installed "Blink" example program.  After uploading the program, the embedded LED on the device began to blink.  We're in business!

The program output looked like this:

```
Executable segment sizes:
ICACHE : 32768           - flash instruction cache 
IROM   : 231756          - code in flash         (default or ICACHE_FLASH_ATTR) 
IRAM   : 26777   / 32768 - code in IRAM          (IRAM_ATTR, ISRs...) 
DATA   : 1496  )         - initialized variables (global, static) in RAM/HEAP 
RODATA : 876   ) / 81920 - constants             (global, static) in RAM/HEAP 
BSS    : 25608 )         - zeroed variables      (global, static) in RAM/HEAP 
Sketch uses 260905 bytes (24%) of program storage space. Maximum is 1044464 bytes.
Global variables use 27980 bytes (34%) of dynamic memory, leaving 53940 bytes for local variables. Maximum is 81920 bytes.
