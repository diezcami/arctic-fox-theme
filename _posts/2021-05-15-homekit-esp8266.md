> HomeKit-ifying every last corner of my apartment - for better or worse - has become a hobby (thing-that-I-do?) of mine as of lately.  After stumbling upon [Andrew Ngai's awesome YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5Ox_uFtGn0) on designing and implementing his own HomeKit accessory, I too felt inspired to hack around a bit.

## Setup

### Arduino IDE

We'll be using the Arduino IDE to write our firmware to our development module.

First, add the following "Additional Boards Manager URL" in the IDE's `Preferences`. 

```
http://Arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json
```

The source code and docs for this module [live here](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino).

Then, in `Tools` > `Board: X` > `Board Manager`, search and install the ESP8266 board manager.

I bought [these development boards](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B081CSJV2V/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) from Amazon.  In the product description they provided additional instructions on setup. Your specific board may have different settings, mine instructed me to --

- Set ESP8266 board type to `NodeMCU 1.0 (ESP-12E Module)
- Set Flash Size to `4M`
- Set CPU Freqency to `80 Mhz`
- Set bod speed to  `921600`

I then simply attached my device via microUSB, selected my device via the "port", and ran the Arduino pre-installed "Blink" example program.  After uploading the program, the embedded LED on the device began to blink.  We're in business!

The program output looked like this:

```
Executable segment sizes:
ICACHE : 32768           - flash instruction cache 
IROM   : 231756          - code in flash         (default or ICACHE_FLASH_ATTR)

Here I found the pin-out of my specific board --

As a PoC I decided to break out my tiny breadboard, some LEDs, and write a couple lines of code to flash them.  The result -- some pretty colors!

![5.gif]({{site.url}}/assets/resources-homekit-esp8266/5.gif)


```c
#define LED_RED 1
#define LED_YELLOW 3
#define LED_GREEN 15

#define NUM_LEDS 3

int values[NUM_LEDS]  = { LED_RED, LED_YELLOW, LED_GREEN };

// the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
void setup() {

  pinMode(LED_RED, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(LED_YELLOW, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(LED_GREEN, OUTPUT);
}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
  // Wait a sec
  delay(1000);

  // Cascade the LEDs on
  for (int i = 0; i < NUM_LEDS; i++) {
    digitalWrite(values[i], HIGH);
    delay(500);
  }

  // Wait a sec
  delay(1000);

  // Cascade the LEDs off
  for (int i = 0; i < NUM_LEDS; i++) {
    digitalWrite(values[NUM_LEDS - i - 1], LOW);
    delay(500);
  }
}
```

## HomeKit

Great, we now have the board and our IDE talking to each other.  Next, I took a peek at Mixiaoxiao's [Arduino-Homekit-ESP8266](https://github.com/Mixiaoxiao/Arduino-HomeKit-ESP8266) library on GitHub.
