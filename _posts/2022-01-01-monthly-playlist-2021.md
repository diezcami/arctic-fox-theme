 I don't often think of myself as an innately creative person, yet each year I feel a sense of pride (and emotion) looking back at the music i've collected each month.  I don't journal, or really keep much of a record of my life beyond the odd photo during an event. Yet, embedded in these playlists I immediate transport back to a snapshot of my life - the feelings, the people, the relationships either born or fading away. 

This is the fourth year i've of the playlist journal.  I made it extra difficult this year by using morse code abbreviations as playlist names.
