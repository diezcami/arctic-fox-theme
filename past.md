I’m **Josh** - a Boston-based graduate of Khoury College at [**Northeastern University**](http://ccs.neu.edu/home/joshua).

🖥️ I started full time at Microsoft early 2020 on the [Xamarin](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/xamarin) Tooling team. 

🖥️ Previously i'd interned in M365's Intelligent Conversation and Communication Cloud (IC3) group.

☕️ I abide by the three C's: <b>concerts, coffee</b>, and <b>[cats](../cinnamon)</b>.

<br>
### What i've done.

<br>
🔏 Co-op'ed for seven months as a **Security Consultant** for [**Virtual Security Research**](http://vsecurity.com). I performed application, network, and mobile **penetration testing** for client companies.

🌐 Co-op'ed (again) - this time at [**Akamai Technologies**](https://akamai.com/) on their **Enterprise Network Engineering team**.

🏡 Lived (briefly) in [**Florence, Italy**](https://joshspicer.com/geo-fellowship) and more recently in [**Edinburgh, UK**](https://joshspicer.com/hitch-to-paris), where I studied abroad at the University of Edinburgh.

<br>
### What else do I do?

<br>
🐘 Develop [**Parade**](https://parade.events/) - an event discovery platform for Northeastern clubs. Find us on the [iOS App Store](https://parade.events/ios) and [Google Play Store](https://parade.events/android).  Learn more about our campus impact over on [News@Northeastern.](https://news.northeastern.edu/2019/07/23/want-to-know-whats-happening-on-northeasterns-boston-campus-theres-an-app-for-that/)

🎧 Spend (too much) time (and money) constructing elaborate [spotify playlists]({{site.url}}/monthly-playlist-2018) and buying concert tickets. I <3 cheap shows and discovering new music - help me out by adding something to my [public queue](https://joshspicer.com/queue)!

🎛 Participated on the [**Collegiate Cyber Defense Team**](https://nuccdc.club/). This year we have advanced on to regionals!

🌋 Help produce [**Survivor Northeastern**](http://survivornortheastern.com). I played season 3 - check it out on YouTube _soon_!

🖥 Founded the Computer Science Mentoring Organization [(CoSMO)](http://cosmo.khoury.northeastern.edu/eboard/past) at Northeastern. CoSMO runs interactive technical workshops and student-driven panels throughout the semester - let me know if you'd like to run one!
